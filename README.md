# Protein Structure Prediction

Proteins are the molecular machines vital to every cell and organism, and understanding their structure is crucial for the discovery of new drugs to treat diseases or the discovery of new materials. Researchers have now made significant progress toward this goal by developing machine learning (ML) algorithms capable of accurately predicting the folded shapes of proteins and other biomolecules.

In this repo, I’m compiling resources on how protein folding works, how AlphaFold2 predicts novel protein structures, and how the newer AlphaFold3 model works. To start with, I've written a blog post that discusses these topics in more detail. In the future, I am planning to add exercises, dive deeper into AlphaFold3, RosettaFold and ESMFold.
